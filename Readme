AI-Based Code Explainer
This project provides an AI-based tool to generate human-readable explanations for Python code. It uses local AI models (CodeLlama and Mistral) via the Ollama framework to analyze Python scripts and produce clear, beginner-friendly explanations.

Features
Code Explanation: Generates plain-language explanations for Python code.
Local AI Models: Uses CodeLlama and Mistral models for efficient and private code analysis.
Customizable: Choose between different AI models for explanations.

Prerequisites
Before using the tool, ensure the following are installed on your system:
Python 3.x: Download and install Python from python.org.
Ollama: Download and install Ollama from ollama.ai.

Required Python Libraries:
Install the ollama and argparse libraries:
pip install ollama argparse
Pull the AI Models:
Pull the required AI models using Ollama:
ollama pull codellama
ollama pull mistral
Run the Script:
Use the code_explainer.py script to generate explanations for Python code.
example
python code_explainer.py example.py --model mistral
Replace example.py with the path to your Python script.

--model: Choose the AI model (codellama or mistral). Default is codellama.

View the Explanation:
The AI-generated explanation will be printed in the terminal.
Example
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))

Command:
python code_explainer.py example.py --model mistral
Output:
ðŸ’¡ AI Explanation:
This Python code defines a function called `greet` that takes a single argument `name`. The function returns a greeting message that includes the provided name. The `print` statement calls the `greet` function with the argument `"Alice"`, resulting in the output: `Hello, Alice!`.

Technical Limitations
Generalized Explanations: The tool provides high-level explanations and may not cover all details.
Complex Code: Explanations for highly complex code may require manual verification.
Model Dependency: The quality of explanations depends on the selected AI model.

Ethical Considerations
Accuracy: AI-generated explanations may contain errors or biases. Always verify the output.
Sensitive Code: Avoid processing sensitive or proprietary code through the tool.

Future Enhancements
GUI Integration: Add a graphical user interface for better usability.
Multi-Language Support: Extend support to other programming languages.
Fine-Tuned Models: Improve explanation accuracy with fine-tuned AI models.
